This is a simple plugin that enables automatic PHP syntax checking when a file
is saved. When a error is detected, Vim will jump to the line with the error,
and underline that line with a curly red underline.

Known bug(s): Sometimes the red curly underline does not go away automatically.
If this happens, simply run `:match`.
